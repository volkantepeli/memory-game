# Memory Game APP (React/Redux)
React.js & Redux ; I developed with. A classic memory game. In each new game, the cards are dealt randomly. The cards are opened one by one and their partners are tried to be found. Cards with matches remain face up. Each wrong attempt deducts 10 points. 50 points increase for each correct match. You can start the game from the beginning with the new game button.
